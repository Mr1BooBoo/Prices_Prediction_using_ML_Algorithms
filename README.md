a Short description about the project:
1. The data-set used in this project consists of 10 factors and a target variable (set 28 days in the future)
2. the goal was to predict said prices using the given factors after studying the correlation between them
3. results are good based on the MAE and R2 metrics and the plots show great potential in predicting spikes in the prices
